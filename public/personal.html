<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>I got in to coding because I love being creative and solving problems. I'm new with webdev<br/>
and have previously worked with game development. I'm looking forward to combining my<br/>
coding skills with my sense of style. I promise I will make much more beautiful websites<br/>
once I've learned CSS.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I jump between hobbies constantly which makes me a great learner. Besides coding, I play<br/>
the piano, draw, play video games. I am also into fashion, fragrances, languages/different<br/>
cultures, politics, video editing, philosophy, psychology, astronomy and much more!<br/>
I am also looking for work as a model on the side.
